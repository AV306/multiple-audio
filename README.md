# Don't use this.

Just take a breadboard, *n* 3.5mm jack sockets (one for each device), an old 3.5mm cable and some jumper wires (get about *4n*).

1. Cut one end off the cable, and expose the wires
2. Stick each end of the smaller wires into one breadboard row
3. Solder the jumper wire ends to the sockets if necessary
4. Stick the other ends of the jumper wires into the corresponding breadboard row, so that the power from each segment of the original cable is split across the *n* sockets arranged in parallel
5. Plug it in and hope nothing explodes
