# Don't use this software.

### I'm only half joking here, this method is *much* simpler than what we can do with software

Just take a breadboard, *n* 3.5mm jack sockets (one for each device), an old 3.5mm audio cable and some jumper wires (get about *4n*).

1. Cut one end off the audiocable, and expose the wires
2. Stick each end of the smaller wires into one breadboard row (you may need to add jumper wire male leads wires)
3. Solder the jumper wire ends to the jack sockets if necessary, or use crocodile clip ends
4. Stick the other ends of the jumper wires into the corresponding breadboard row, so that the power from each segment of the original cable is split across the *n* sockets arranged in parallel
5. Plug it in and hope nothing explodes
6. Add resistors if something does explode
